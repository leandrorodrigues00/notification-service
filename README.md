## üë©‚Äçüíª About the project

This project was developed with the goal of creating and managing a notification microservice in an organized, scalable, and well-structured way. Using NestJS as the main framework integrated with Prisma as the ORM, the application follows modern development principles such as SOLID architecture, dependency injection, and the factory pattern for creating complex objects and services. Business rules and use cases are implemented clearly, connecting all layers of the application, including routes, controllers, validations, and services. Additionally, the project includes automated tests to ensure quality and reliability, establishing a robust and sustainable solution.
